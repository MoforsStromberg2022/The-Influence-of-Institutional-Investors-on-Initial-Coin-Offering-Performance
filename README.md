README File - The Influence of Institutional Investors on ICO Performance
This readme file explains how to create all the tables and regressions for the thesis “The Influence of Institutional Investors on ICO Performance” of Rebecka Mofors and Maja Strömberg. 

First start with collecting the prices and market capitalization from CoinMarketCap to calculate the Buy and Hold Abnormal Return (BHAR). This you will do though Python. Start with opening the following files; API Datum 1, 180, 360.CSV, API BHAR.py. When the files are open ensure that python recognizes that the files are in the same map to trace back to each other. Furthermore, change the path to the path on your computer to ensure that python finds the right file. To be able to run this code you need to have a personal API key provided by CoinMarketCap. To receive this API key you must purchase it from CoinMarketCap using the “Professional” package, we are not allowed to share the key and you must buy it yourselves. After adding the right path and API key you can start running the API BHAR.py code to get the prices and market capitalization. To calculate the BHAR in python open BHAR.py. Change the path to the so python find the csv file with the collected prices and market capitalization. Run the code in python. 

Our final dataset is also included in the zip-file for all information.
